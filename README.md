# Final Project: Visibike Code Repository
 
This project addresses a critical need for improved visibility on bicycles. The microcontroller allows us to implement brake lights and turn signals via user-friendly buttons on the handlebars and a speedometer through a sensor and display. This system aims to enhance safety and promote smoother interactions between cyclists and motorists.
